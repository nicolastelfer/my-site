            <p>I combine both design and development skills to provide users with the best online experience.</p>
            <p>By using a responsive development approach I make sure anyone can engage with the products I build no matter the context or device they use to access it.</p>

            <p>Having started my career as a wed designer, I understand the process of visualizing a brief and turning it into something tangible and beautiful to the eye.</p>
            <p>AS a UX developer, I work closely with the creative team and together, we define user journerys and efficient workflows to best match the needs of our clients.</p>

            <h2 class="headline md-headline headline-type-two">The Future Me</h2>
            <p>In order to improve my JavaScript knowledge, I'll be taking a 3 day full-on course in January. I hope to see the benefits in the work I'll be producing after.</p>
            <p><strong>Update:</strong> I've also joined a workshop into BackBone.js which I'll be learning further skills into JavaScript and templating. </p>
            <p>I will keep improving this site as a way to explore and showcase my design and technical abilities in the coming months.</p>
            <p>Finally, I have plans to release a few of the projects I have in mind so I'll be looking for some people interested in collaborating or becoming a partner to realize those projects.</p>

            <h2 class="headline md-headline headline-type-two">What else?</h2>
            <p>I am going to have my business online. I know that and I want that for me.</p>
            <p>Everyone has ideas, and so do I, but taking action to turn those ideas into business projects it's completely different. </p>
            <p>That is why I try to attend as many events as I can to learn and get inspired by amazing people. Networking and sharing thoughts is a step forward to achieving my goals.</p>
