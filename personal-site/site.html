            <p>I combine both design and development skills to provide users with the best online experience.</p>
            <p>By using a responsive development approach I make sure anyone can engage with the products I build no matter the context or device they use to access it.</p>
            <p>I'm currently employed at <a href="http://www.orangutanstudio.com" class="btn btn-secondary" target="_blank">orangutan studio</a> where I've been able to craft my skills with HTML5 and CSS3 in some really interesting projects such as <a href="http://www.saverarmstrong.com" class="btn btn-secondary" target="_blank">Save Armstrong</a>, <a href="http://www.maxfordham.com" class="btn btn-secondary" target="_blank">Max Fordham</a> or <a href="http://www.thrislingtoncubicles.com" class="btn btn-secondary" target="_blank">Thrislinton</a> among others.</p>

            <h2 class="headline md-headline headline-type-two">What's to come</h2>

            <p>I have big plans for next year, starting by joining a JavaScript course with the aim to speed up my abilities with this language.
            Secondly, I will be continuing to attend as many events as I can possibly can that will improve my network within the industry.</p>
            <p>Finally, I have plans to release a few of the projects I have in mind so I'll be looking for some people interested in collaborating or becoming a partner to realize those projects.</p>
